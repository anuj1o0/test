Realtime Speech To Text 
Description
This project allows users to convert real-time speech into text using a simple interface. By following the steps below, you will be able to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Installation
To use this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

transformers: A Python library for natural language processing tasks. Install it by running the following command:
shell

"pip install transformers -q"

gradio: A Python library for creating interfaces for machine learning models. Install it by running the following command:
shell

"pip install gradio -q"

Usage
Once you have installed the required dependencies, follow these steps to run the project:

Open your favorite integrated development environment (IDE) or text editor.

Clone the project repository from GitHub to your local machine.

Open the project in your IDE or navigate to the project directory using the command line.

Locate the main code file, typically named app.py or similar, and open it.

Run the code, and it will create a local host for the app using the Gradio interface.

On the Gradio interface, you will see a microphone button. Click on it to give the necessary permission to access your microphone.

Start speaking, and the application will convert your real-time speech into text.

Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the installation or usage of this project, please check the following:

Make sure you have correctly installed the required dependencies: transformers and gradio.

Ensure that your microphone is properly connected and functioning.

Verify that you have granted the necessary permissions for the application to access your microphone.

If you are still experiencing difficulties, please reach out to the project maintainer for further assistance.

Acknowledgments
